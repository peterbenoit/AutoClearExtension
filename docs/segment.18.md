### segment.18.md — Keyboard Accessibility and Tab Order Cleanup

Improve the popup’s accessibility and usability via keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

1. In `popup.html`:

    - Ensure all interactive elements are reachable via `Tab` in a logical order
    - Use `tabindex="0"` only when necessary (e.g., non-input elements needing focus)
    - Add `aria-label` or `aria-describedby` to:
        - Buttons without clear context (e.g. “Clear Log”, “Reset Rules”)
        - Dynamic regions like rule summaries or the debug log panel

2. In `style.css` (if needed):

    - Add focus outlines only if the browser default is insufficient
    - Improve visual indication of focus for keyboard users

3. In `popup.js`:
    - Ensure toggled sections (e.g. TTL input, debug panel) set proper `aria-expanded` and `aria-hidden` as applicable
    - If dynamic content is injected, consider setting `role="log"` or `aria-live="polite"` where needed

This segment ensures the extension’s popup interface respects accessibility expectations without changing core layout or functionality.
